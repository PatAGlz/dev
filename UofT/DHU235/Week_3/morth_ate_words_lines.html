	<line> A moth ate words. To me that seemed </line>
	<line> a marvellous fate, when I heard about that wonder, </line>
	<line> that a worm swallowed a certain man's song,</line>
	<line> the thief in darkness, the glorious saying </line>
	<line> and its strong foundation. The thieving guest was not </line>
	<line> a bit the wiser for those words that he swallowed. </line>
