	<line> A moth <verb>ate</verb> words. To me that <verb>seemed</verb> </line>
	<line> a marvellous fate, when I <verb>heard</verb> about that wonder, </line>
	<line> that a worm <verb>swallowed</verb> a certain man's song,</line>
	<line> the thief in darkness, the glorious saying </line>
	<line> and its strong foundation. The thieving guest <verb>was</verb> not </line>
	<line> a bit the wiser for those words that he <verb>swallowed</verb>. </line>
