	<h1>Exeter Riddle 47</h1>

	A moth ate words. To me that seemed
	a marvellous fate, when I heard about that wonder,
	that a worm swallowed a certain man's song,
	the thief in darkness, a glory-fast saying
	and its strong foundation. The thieving guest was not
	a bit the wiser for those words that he swallowed.
